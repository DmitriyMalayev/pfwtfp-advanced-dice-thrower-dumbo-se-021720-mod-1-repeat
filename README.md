# Advanced Die Thrower

## Learning Goals

- Generate variable die throws
- Generate a hash of die throws
- Retrieve conditional results 

## Introduction

In this lab, we're going to continue building a procedural die game.

- Practicing our skills in hashes, looping, and conditions.

## Generate Variable Die Throws

Let's create 2 methods: `roll_prompt` and `throw_variable_die`. The `roll_prompt`
method will accept any number of sides from 3 to 100. When a valid number is passed
in, print a message that says "We're rolling a `[number_of_sides] `sided die!". If
a number less than 3 or greater than 100 is passed in, it should return "Oops! This
die does not exist. Please enter a number between 3 and 100".

**NOTE:** Use `prints` instead of `puts` to print output to the terminal.

Similarly to `throw_die` in a preview less, the `throw_variable_die` method will roll
the die, but instead of using a fixed number of 6, it will accept the same integer that
was passed into `roll_prompt`.

**HINT:** Randomly generated integers start at 0. Make sure that your accommodates
for this so that 0 is not a possible number that can be rolled.

## Generate a Hash of Die Throws

Next, let's write a method called `generate_hash_set` that returns a set of die
throws. Each time the die is thrown, it will store the result to hash. Store the
current roll as the key, and the result as the value. For example, if we roll a 6
sided die 5 times, it might look like the following:

```ruby
{
    1 => 5
    2 => 2
    3 => 2
    4 => 6
    5 => 4
}
```

## Retrieve Conditional Results

Lastly, we'll build a method called `lucky_number_seven`. If a number greater than 6
is passed in as the number of sides in `generate_hash_set`, it's possible that we could
roll a "lucky number 7"! If a "7" is rolled, print "You're pretty lucky!". If "7" is rolled
2 or more times _in a row_, create a condition that prints "Wow, you're on a roll!". If there are
no values of "7" in your hash, it will print "No such luck this time!". This method should only
accept only 1 argument--the hash generated by `generate_hash_set`.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You were able to utilize and potentially refactor existing code
and create more complex, game-like methods to your Ruby program. Are there ways
that the methods can be split up even further for simplicity? Keep this in mind
as your programs become more complex.
